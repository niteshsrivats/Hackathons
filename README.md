- *Workflow Management Tool* for predefined processes that can be broken up into *Stories* and *Tasks*. This is not a solution for development (Clubhouse, Jira, etc) but rather for banks, law firms, etc that have repeating processes and personel involed.
- *File Storage Solution* similar to google drive. Files can be approved and even contain digital signatutes.
- *Configurable* in the way that access roles can be defined by the organization and is not a constant set. Email can be integrated as well to communicate in organization defined workflows.

# Dot Slash 2020
The solution developed was an API to provide remote code execution which allows any online application to compile and execute code remotely on a pay per scale basis. The user is provided a comprehensive dashboard showing usage statistics, billings per API key, billing per request, memory and CPU time used. For a higher cost, the user can also store the executed script and the output.

# India Police Hackathon 2019 - Top 5
A solution was required to track and manage personel, ensure constables were on duty and digitize routine works in a centralized manner. 

Mobile solution:
- The problem statement had a primary objective of ensuring constables were not snoozing on the job, are alert and on duty. They would often give their phones away and keep the sim cards for taking phone calls to trick any kind of tracking app. To counter this, OTPs sent at random intervals are automatically read to ensure the phone always had the official sim card.
- The constable was also pinged for location every 2 minutes (To keep battery usage to a minimum) to calculate an approximate area of coverage by the constable.
- The app allowed reporting of routine beats and requesting addition personel incase of emergencies.
- The app pushes for public interaction with *beat members* where the constable simply has to scan a QR code in the beat member's mobile device (QR code is obtained from a public domain website after authentication). 

Companion Web App:
- Displays in real time the last known location of every constable.
- Reports of each beat under each station can be managed from here.
- Performace reports on beats and each constable
